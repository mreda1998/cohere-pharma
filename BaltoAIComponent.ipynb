            "Summary: Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, is a common painkiller and antipyretic, used all over the world. It is very hepatotoxic in cases of overdose or harmful drug interactions and may cause death from fulminant hepatitis. Its antidote is more effective if administered within eight hours of ingestion. If the degree of toxicity is uncertain, N-acetylcysteine must be administered until intoxication is excluded. In countries using the common name, paracetamol is used; in France, it is also known as acetaminophen. Its toxicity for the liver was demonstrated, resulting in its withdrawal from the market. Interest in paracetamol was renewed due to its apparent good tolerance, and it is now used in many combination drugs.\n"
